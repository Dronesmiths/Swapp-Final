# SWAPP (Soulwinning App) - Integrated Knowledge Base

## 1. Core Philosophy & Platform Mission
SWAPP is a "built by the church, for the church" platform. It transitions church software from staff-heavy business management to **member-centric engagement**.

*   **Goal**: Offload administrative workloads from staff while giving members tools to be better engaged with their church and one another.
*   **Structure**: 
    *   **Dashboard (Web Admin)**: For oversight, mapping configuration, CRM management, and church-wide settings.
    *   **Mobile App (Member Tool)**: For real-time outreach participation, ministry engagement, prayer, and personal follow-ups.

## 2. The Launch Path: 5 Steps to Setup
For new churches, follow this sequential path to go from registration to your first outreach.

### Step 1: Registration
Register at `thesoulwinningapp.com`. The first account created becomes the **Head Admin**, with exclusive access to billing and global security settings.

### Step 2: Branding & Integration
In the **Settings** tab:
*   **Logo**: Upload a church logo (PNG) to replace default branding.
*   **Giving**: Add Tithely, PayPal, or custom website links for the member profile.
*   **Security**: Set a "Joining Password" to keep your database private.

### Step 3: Geography (Folders)
Before drawing maps, create **Folders** (Sections). Think of these as broad zones (e.g., North, South, Downtown). This organizes the map list for your members.

### Step 4: Drawing Your Territories (Maps)
Inside a folder, use the **Polyline Tool** to draw routes. 
*   **Target Size**: 30-60 doors per map.
*   **Naming**: Use consistent formats like `[Folder]-[ID]` (e.g., `N-01`).

### Step 5: Equipping the Team
Share your church's unique **Referral Code** with members. Once they join via the mobile app, you can toggle trusted leaders to **Admin** status in the "Team" tab so they can manage mapping from their devices.

## 3. Outreach & Mapping Mechanics
The engine behind SWAPP's mapping system.

### Hierarchy
1.  **Folders**: Broad zones. Red indicates no available maps.
2.  **Maps**: Individual routes.
3.  **Pins**: 
    *   **Green (Contact)**: Lead with details.
    *   **Red (Do Not Knock)**: Privacy flag.
    *   **Purple (Note)**: Custom building info (Gate codes, entrance photos).

### Workflow
*   **Claiming**: Members "Check In" (Turns map **Yellow**).
*   **Completion**: After knocking, members "Check Out" and enter door count (Turns map **Red**).
*   **Printing**: Limit of 5 maps per bulk print. Printing automatically marks the map as complete.

## 4. Advanced Strategies
*   **The Spiral Method**: Start mapping at the church and work outward in increasing circles for urban saturation.
*   **Quadrants**: Use NW, NE, SE, SW suffixes for naming folders to aid navigation.
*   **Apartment Logic**: Divide large complexes into multiple "Building Cluster" maps to avoid overwhelming a single team.

---

## 5. CRM & Contact Management
Standalone database for members and prospects.
*   **Folders vs. Master List**: Every contact is in the "All Contacts" list. Folders act as tags. Deleting from a folder only removes the tag.
*   **Folder QR Codes**: Generate a QR code per folder for lead capture (visitor cards, web forms). Submissions are auto-tagged to that folder.
*   **Shared Appointments**: Admins can share a contact with a member, appearing in their "Appointments" tab for follow-up.

---

## 6. Ministries & Social Features
*   **Ministries**: Internal groups (Youth, Sunday School) with dedicated Prayer Feeds and Calendars.
*   **Social Feed**: A unified prayer feed with likes, comments, and real-time push notifications.
*   **Events**: Recurring event engine synced to member mobile calendars.

---

## 7. Pricing & Billing Tuning
*   **Tiers**: Free (0-2 users), Basic (3-20), Gold (21-150), Platinum (151+).
*   **Auto-Adjustment**: Tiers adjust automatically based on **Active App Users**. You never pay for more than you need.

---

## 8. Advanced Troubleshooting
*   **Reset Emails**: Usually in Spam/Promotions. Check within 60 seconds.
*   **Case Sensitivity**: Email logins are case-sensitive on both mobile and web.
*   **Admin Role Drop**: If an admin loses access, Head Admin must re-toggle them in the Team section.
*   **Map Sync**: If status is stuck, use the **Refresh** button next to the street in the Dashboard Map List.

All right, in this video, let's dive into the events and the
0:09
news feed or the prayer feed, which will also lead us into the
0:15
ministries or the groups functionality within the uh app and the software. So,
0:21
let's go into the events first.
0:27
we click over um on the events section of the uh dashboard or the admin view.
0:33
And when we click on the events, you're going to be um presented with a pretty
0:39
familiar thing that you would imagine um seeing with events and that's the
0:45
calendar view. You're going to have a month view of the calendar where you can see the entire month with some um you
0:53
know, of course, when you're when you haven't put any events in, there's going to be uh it's just going to be a blank
1:02
calendar. And then over on the right hand side, you have the
1:08
the hour breakdown of the day that you're clicked on. So, if I click on a
1:13
particular day, it's going to bring up that hour breakdown from midnight to
1:19
um you know, 11:00 p.m. the next day. And then I can see um with the hour
1:25
breakdown what what is happening at what times of that day.
1:33
And so, um and then on each one of these days on
1:41
the month view, you're going to have little dots indicating that there's an
1:46
event on that day. And you can mouse over that dot, see the name of the event, or you can click on that day and
1:54
then scroll to the uh the hourly view and see that
2:00
um the details of that event. And then if I click on it
2:07
on the hourly section, I can click on that um event.
2:15
It's going to pop up the window of the details of that event. And it's going to
2:21
tell me um you know, of course, all of the details
2:26
that we put in, which is the name, the description, the start and the end date, the time,
2:34
the end time, and then you know the repetition for this. And so
2:40
how often is it repeated? Is it repeated every week, every day, every month,
2:46
uh once a year? And so those options are there. And then
2:53
you also have the option to be able to make turn this event into a ministry or
2:59
a group event. um if you would like to do that, but by default it just leaves
3:05
them in the uh main church calendar event when you're adding them in the
3:10
event section, the main event section. So, you can change also the location of this
3:19
event. So, this event will have an address or a location that you can add to it. And then, um I have a few options
3:26
on the bottom for being able to update just this one event or I can or update
3:33
the all of the this event and all of the reoccurring events
3:38
or I can delete all of the events or I can delete all of the future events or I
3:46
can delete only this event. And so those other delete options are for reoccurring
3:51
events. And so if you don't if you want to make sure you entirely clear this event out of your calendar, you'll want
3:57
to make sure that you delete all of them to do that. But if you only want to delete the ones in the future and leave
4:03
the the history for the ones in the past, you can delete the future ones.
4:09
And and or if you only want to delete one out of the reoccurring, you can do
4:14
that. So that's kind of the basic overview of uh of that. And then of course you can
4:22
scroll through the uh through the months by going next and previous and look
4:27
through the different months. And then you can also add an event from here. If I click on add an event, I can add in
4:36
all those details we just went over in the edit window where I can add the title, add the description, the start
4:42
and end date, and then the start and end time with the repetition, and then the
4:48
address and a ministries option if you want to add this event to certain
4:55
ministries. And so that's kind of how that
5:01
functionality will work. And then over on the mobile app, it's going to be very similar. If I click on the events on the
5:08
bottom navigation, and that's right in the middle, I can see the monthly calendar with little dots on each day.
5:16
And if I click on a particular dot, a particular day, it's going to show me the hourly breakdown of that day
5:23
underneath the uh monthly calendar. and I can see the um events that are
5:30
happening that day uh and when they're happening. And then I can click on that
5:36
if I want to see the details about that event. And um if I'm an admin user, I'll be
5:44
able to um make changes to this event from the app or delete it or uh get some
5:51
navigation to this and and there will likely be some some other fine-tuned features in the future like checking
5:57
into these events or RSVPing for events and um and some other things like that.
6:03
But the other thing that I can do um if I'm an admin user and I'm in the section
6:09
is I can also add an event from here. And there will be a little plus button on the bottom right. And if I click on
6:16
that, it brings me up with all of the details, the same details that we need to add an event over on the dashboard.
6:22
We need to add the event over here. And so you'll need to make sure that you put all of those information in. And you can
6:28
hit save and it will add that to the calendar. And so that's kind of the the
6:34
purpose of that. And then every app user will get notifications about these events and and it helps your church just
6:41
be more um on the same page with what's happening and what's going on and when
6:47
it's happening, how to get there and uh maybe some of the even the details that
6:53
need to be known about that event. And so it really helps with facilitate
6:58
facilitating those things. And then the other thing I want to show you about is
7:04
the prayer feed. So the prayer feed is for the most part a mobile app ccentric
7:12
feature. And right now it's currently we just refer to it as a prayer feed but
7:17
really to be honest it's just a feed um that you'll be able to post things in.
7:24
And currently you can post things um prayer requests in. If I click on the plus button, you'll be able to add the
7:31
details of a of a prayer request. Um, admin users can do it, non-admin users
7:38
can do it. Um and and your your entire church will have this uh unified feed
7:46
right on the homepage and your church members will be able to like these
7:51
prayer, you know, prayer requests that are added, comment on them, and of course, ideally pray for them as they
7:58
see these. Um and as an admin user, you'll be able to delete everything
8:03
that's on this list. And so if somebody posts something that you don't want to be on that list, you can delete all of them. Um but regular normal members are
8:12
only capable of deleting their own um prayer requests and and you know you'll
8:18
have a little delete button on the on each each item that you'll be able to hit that delete and delete it if you
8:24
want to do that. And on these on these u the details of this prayer feed it's
8:30
just going to look very much like a social media type feed where where you
8:35
have these items that you can like comment interact with. You'll be able to see who posted the request, the prayer
8:42
request itself, how long ago it was posted, and and and try to, you know,
8:48
you'll just all be a little more updated and uh be able to share um you know,
8:54
prayer chains and prayer requests a lot more easily.
9:00
Um with regards to
9:12
helping your church be on board with those things. And so, um,
9:19
in in the very near future, there will be other functions that are added to this prayer feed and events will show up
9:26
on this prayer feed. Uh, when it's relevant for events to show up on this prayer feed, you'll be able to post
9:32
other things. Um, you know, Bible verses and um and and and even schedule some
9:40
other things so that um
9:46
really anything you want to communicate to your church family can be posted right in this uh news feed. And then um
9:54
everybody that has the mobile app, anytime something enters this this
10:00
prayer feed, everybody that has the mobile app will get a notification.
10:05
And you know, if it's a prayer, then it's just going to say, you know, somebody added me a new prayer request
10:10
or you know, so and so added a new prayer request. And then they can click on that and go to the app and uh see
10:17
what that prayer request is and pray for them. And so in the context of, you know, when you're going to be able to
10:23
post other things into it, it will notify them about that. You know, whether it's just an announcement or
10:28
whether you've shared a Bible verse or whether you've shared uh some sermon notes or when you um you know, when an
10:37
event is starting. And so if you've created an event for your Sunday services, um you know, the notifications
10:45
for the events and when they're um happening, you know,
10:52
a few hours before it happens, the day before it happens, a few hours before it happens, and then the moment that it's
10:57
happening, uh those notifications will go out or or or in some, you know, some
11:03
similar fashion to that. And so that's kind of how the uh the news feed works
11:08
or the prayer feed. And now that brings us over to ministries. And so, um, one
11:16
more thing real quick. If you go over to if you do the dashboard dropdown and you go over to prayers, you will be able to
11:25
see on the dashboard the prayers that have been submitted here. And of course,
11:30
you can from here if you need to like them and comment on them. um and also
11:37
delete them from here if you need to be able to do that.
11:44
So now we've gone over those two things. That brings us to ministries. And the
11:49
reason that I wanted to go over those two items first is because now ministries or groups as you might maybe
11:57
refer to them or you know think about them as is just groups of app users that
12:05
you have given the ability to have their own prayer feed or news feed
12:12
and then their own events.
12:18
And so it's a group of app users that need to communicate with each other without notifying the whole church is
12:26
really what ministries is and what its purpose is. And then you know there's
12:31
there will be some new things that will be added to ministries regarding check-in capabilities
12:37
uh you know and that that can be used for um and and we'll develop that in in
12:43
a very wide variety of capabilities as not every ministry is going to look for
12:50
check-ins in the same type of way. And so, you know, we'll make a mobile app uh
12:55
centric check-in. We'll try to make a mobile app or a um you know, a rosterbased checkin and and then also
13:04
maybe even an eventbased check-in. And so, um we'll we'll those things will be
13:11
kind of rounded out regarding that. But, you know, the ministries section on the mobile app, if you go over to the
13:17
ministries section, you'll be able to see all of the ministries or groups that are made
13:23
visible to the app users. And then if you go over to the ministry section on
13:28
the dashboard, you'll see all of the ministries that have been added in your church. And of course, if there is none
13:34
that's been added, then both those lists will be blank. But ideally, you'll want to add a ministry. And so, you're going
13:41
to do that from the dashboard. side of things. And when you click on
13:46
the add button on the top right, you're going to be given an option to give it a
13:51
title and then change the status uh you know of that
13:59
ministry and give it a description. And then you can actually make this ministry
14:05
public or private. And so if you need to create a ministry, you can create that
14:11
ministry, get the you need in that ministry and then make that ministry disappear off the app list so that you
14:18
don't have other people coming into it uh that don't need to be in there. And then you also um will be able to create
14:28
a time and a place and a date. So this ministry can also have a
14:35
um location and a u time and a place to
14:40
meet. And so you can add those other details to it. And that's going to be very much so like an event. And so um
14:49
your meeting place, your event meeting place that you're
14:55
going to want to um make sure your ministry people are getting to. Um
15:01
you'll want to put that in during the creation of the ministry. And then of course you do that. You're going to hit
15:08
the save button. and you can um then edit that ministry. And so you'll see a
15:15
list of your ministries with the the title, the description, and and some of
15:20
the other details about it. And on the far right column, you'll be able to see
15:26
a a little edit button and a little delete button. You can either delete
15:31
this or you can edit this ministry and
15:37
change all those details that you just added or you can click on that ministry line item and go into that ministry and
15:46
see all of the things inside that ministry. And so you'll be able to see the the
15:52
unified prayer feed that that ministry has and how that's being used and what
15:58
that's uh what's happening in that um
16:05
in the communication inside that uh ministry. But then you can also see which app users are connected to that
16:13
ministry. And you can change them from a normal user to a admin and give um
16:20
somebody just admin privileges just for that ministry. And that will give them the ability to uh create events and then
16:30
um do do other administrative things with that particular ministry. And
16:39
then they can also delete all of the um items that show up on that prayer feed.
16:44
Um so if there's things that show up there, you have somebody in there that can help moderate that and just delete
16:50
those items out of it. And and then you know over here on the dashboard
16:56
um after I look at those users, I can also see the events. And so I can see
17:02
the calendar for this ministry. And so if ministry creates nothing other than
17:08
that initial event which is which is going to be the meeting place and time of that ministry. Um then that calendar
17:16
is just going to for the most part stay blank besides that one. But they have the ability. So if it's a Sunday school
17:22
class or something and they have special other types of events where maybe once a month they get together and play games
17:28
or something or they go out and do do something together um periodically, they
17:33
can add those events and they can stay updated about those events um just within that group or ministry. And so um
17:41
admins can add those from the mobile app or you know you as a um admin can log in
17:48
via the dashboard and add these things uh for them or or give them you know
17:56
full access admits administrators
18:01
um you know the full access not just to ministries when you go to the main team
18:06
list on the dashboard dropdown and you change them from a member to an admin um
18:12
they can actually use their same login credentials for the mobile app and come
18:17
to the website and lo in um and help do
18:23
everything from managing every you know manage everything on the dashboard side of things. So if you have a secretary or
18:29
something uh that you want to be able to have access to this side of things they can they can be given admin access for
18:36
for that. But um that's that's kind of
18:42
the the scope of events and the prayer feed and the ministries. And
18:50
so those are those, you know, are are very useful tools for the sake of
18:56
communication. And the prayer feed, you know, seems like an underwhelming thing, but when it's used well, uh, much many
19:04
there are many church members out there that are longing and desiring to be able to have something that they can better
19:10
communicate with one another. Um, and, you know, stay stay a little better
19:16
updated on when things are and what's happening and just be able to pull it up and look at a calendar or look at the um
19:24
the new prayer requests that have been added and for one another and encourage one another and and so those things are
19:31
are extremely useful tools and just because they seem like a little small thing I wouldn't undervalue those um as
19:38
they are of you know a very useful tool and so and and and shortly in the near
19:45
future we're you know going to be adding some external capabilities for being
19:50
able to collect prayer requests from the community and you could put that maybe just on your website or
19:57
um or the capability of um you know passing out a a track or a
20:03
flyer or something that says how can we pray for you and it'll just take them to um a form that'll allow them to be able
20:10
to submit those prayer requests and those things can go right inside you know either a ministry or the main
20:16
prayer feed um you know however you end up wanting to be able to do that and your church members can pray for these
20:23
people that are in the community that are adding prayer requests and it gives you a better be ability to
20:28
be able to then follow up with those people and reach out to those people that have reached out for help with
20:35
prayer. So, um really really useful tools and um you know um so
20:44
let's move on to um finish out
20:50
the miscellaneous details of the rest of the
20:55
app. And so I want to hop back over to the dashboard dropdown as that's where a
21:02
lot of the remaining functionality is going to be. And then after that we'll
21:07
go over to the profile. Um and inside the profile there's also a couple other
21:13
uh things that are kind of hidden over in the profile section. So, in the
21:18
dashboard dropdown, if I just simply click on dashboard, it's going to take me back to the main
21:23
dashboard where it just gives me a couple um tiles that uh are shortcuts to
21:29
take me to either outreach or contacts and ministries or something like that. So, um that's just more to get you back
21:36
there if you want to get back there. the team list. You know, we
21:41
kind of briefly showed you one of the features in the team list, but the team list is going to be your list of
21:49
um app users that have downloaded the app, created a profile, found your church, and connected with your church.
21:56
And so, um that that's what this list is. And I can
22:01
select um individuals on this list with the little bulk selector checkbox. Um
22:08
and I can also just select them all if I want to. And I can I have the ability to
22:13
select them and remove the members that I want to remove if I need to get rid of some people. Um and then I also
22:22
um can send individual users specific notifications
22:29
or I can not a custom notification to every app user. And so I can select on,
22:35
you know, I can just hit the select box and click send a notification and then type a custom notification and that will
22:41
go out to every every user. But you can also just do that um from the prayer
22:47
feed. If you want to just add a um an announcement or a notification there, you can add that and they'll be they'll
22:53
all be notified and it'll be stored in that main homepage which will be easy for them to get to. And so the
23:00
notifications, these custom notifications can code to individual people and they can receive that. So
23:07
that's um uh that's that's one of the
23:16
that's the team section of the dashboard dropdown. Then there's the check-ins.
23:22
And so if you click on this, you'll be able to see a list of who has checked in
23:27
to a map. This will be this is the checkins for the mapping. And it'll give you the map
23:34
name, who checked in, and then it'll give you the map name. And then it'll
23:40
tell you the check-in time and the checkout time. It'll tell you how many doors they did. And then, of course,
23:46
there's a delete option. So, if you need to just delete some of these uh checkins, maybe you're just testing some
23:52
things and and then you want to come back in and delete that, not have any of that testing data in there or whatever
23:59
reason you want to delete, there's that option there. And then you can filter out these check-ins by a date range. And
24:06
so, you'll just click on that uh date range and then select the start date and the end date and click filter. And
24:13
you'll be able to see all of the check-ins that happen in that date. or you can just search the check-ins
24:19
um which will search the name of the person the team member. So that's
24:26
the check-ins list and then there's also the prayers which I showed you already
24:31
and that'll just take you to the main homepage prayer feed that people are adding to um there. And
24:39
um then there is
24:47
a list of all of the notifications. And so if you if you want to see um some of
24:52
you know all the notifications that have been sent out, there's a there's an option for that. And then the C
24:57
progress, which we went over in a previous video with the with the outreach maps. And that just gives you
25:03
the overview of all of the maps, the individual maps and their progress, whether they're green, yellow, or red.
25:14
And then, so let me hop over to the profile section now. So inside the profile,
25:21
uh there's of course the profile capabilities and you can change the church's name. You can change the um
25:30
first and the last name of the main admin user um and
25:37
the phone number, the email. You can update the address in the profile for the church, where the church is located
25:45
and um and then you also can upload and add your church's logo
25:53
here. and you know pick a you know you may have to edit your profile. You may
25:58
have to edit your logo a little bit to fit the proportions of where this is placed inside the uh the mobile app or
26:05
the dashboard side of things. So if you upload your logo, it will take out that swap uh logo um the swap wording on the
26:14
mobile app and it will replace it with your logo. So when your people come into your come into the app, it it looks
26:22
and feels a little bit more customized and um
26:28
and and has a has more of a feel for that this is your you know your church app. And
26:37
then you of course can change your password. there's a option for referring
26:42
people and you can refer um refer your friends and basically your
26:48
that's just going to copy a link that you can send over to your friends and say hey check this out we use this for
26:55
um for what we do for you know our church
27:01
and it works really well and then you know you'll be able to track that and see um you know where if you know if if
27:11
they signed up because of your referral. And then we have
27:17
some some planning center integration, but we may we may end up um phasing that
27:24
out. Then we have um this option here so that you can toggle on notifications for
27:31
public prayers. And so if if your church gets bigger and maybe too many people are posting to this, you'll be able to
27:38
turn this off. Um if if it's too much of a nuisance um so that when people are posting their
27:44
prayer requests, they're not they're not getting notified over and over and over again. You can of course reset your
27:50
account and this will uh send a send a request to us and then we'll review it
27:56
and just confirm that that's really what you want to do and we will delete it for you. um or reset the da d d d d d d d d
28:04
d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d da in your account or delete your account if if you want to
28:09
do that. There's a QR code option. Now, this QR code will give you a
28:16
the ability to have contacts added right to your all contacts list in your
28:24
contacts, similar to what we went over when I showed you how you could get that done inside um the contacts folders.
28:33
this this QR code here will take them and drop those contacts that are added by way of this QR code into the all
28:41
list. Then there's the giving links. And so if you want to add giving options
28:48
inside the mobile app, you can um paste the giving links that you have um on the
28:55
giving platforms you have, whether you use uh PayPal, whether you use Stripe or
29:01
whether you use Tiithly. Um you can set up Zel. So um people can give straight
29:07
to your church by by way of zel or whatever options you have. you can just
29:12
paste those links uh here. So, and then name the link and so you know
29:24
in and name it in a way that your people will understand what it what the purpose
29:29
of that is. And so, you know, of course, if it's a cash app thing, you know, and you got people that want to give by way
29:36
of Cash App, name it Cash App. Um, but if it's something, you know, unique like, uh, Tithely,
29:43
um, you know, people may not, your members may not understand what Tithely is. And so, it might just be better to
29:51
title that as a credit card option and or a debit card uh, option for giving.
29:58
And um, and so that's kind of the purpose of that. And you can save those. You can
30:04
add new ones or delete them um, accordingly. And your members can find the giving
30:11
if they are in the mobile app and on the homepage.
30:16
And if they click on the profile, they can go down, scroll down to that um
30:23
the the giving options and just click on the giving option they want to do and it'll take them to the uh appropriate
30:30
place to be able to give. It'll just take them to that link. So, and we'll probably give a way to make those giving
30:37
options a little more prominent, maybe landing on the homepage um regularly to remind people to give.
30:44
And then, of course, you have all of your
30:51
card settings with, you know, your card details and the invoices that you've
30:56
been build. And when when they happen, you can export them or resend them to
31:02
yourself or um e export them as a PDF. And then you can see the current plan
Current plan you're on. You can change the plan if you would like. You can um add a church
31:15
joining password. And in here, if you toggle this on,
31:20
you'll need to put a church joining password. And this will allow you to be able to lock people out from just being
31:26
able to into your church from anybody being able to just search for your church from the mobile app and come into
31:33
your church um and and and interact with it that way. And so that's that's an
31:38
option that uh you have once you kind of have put you know more information into the the app and you're you've started
31:46
using it more. Um that's a level of security that's available.
31:52
And then you have the kiosk mode. And so the kiosk mode
31:58
will allow you to be able to put up a maybe a computer or something in your um
32:06
lobby and your church members that um maybe don't use the mobile app for the
32:12
doortodoor outreach, they can just come to the kiosk and um find the map that
32:18
they want to go do and they can just print off that map. And you know, you of course would need to have that kiosk
32:24
connected to a printer and they can just print maps off themselves if that's an approach you want to do or they can
32:31
print off uh follow-up visits for themsel um if that's if you want to make
32:36
it available for them that way. And so that's an option. And then um we have a
32:42
scheduled you know auto opening and closing for maps. And so, you know, at the end of the year, if you don't feel
32:47
like coming back into the maps and uh editing them yourselves and selecting them all and opening them, um you can
32:54
just schedule this to happen at a certain time every year. And then you can always come in here and cancel it.
33:01
Um cancel that schedule job if you want to do that.
33:07
So, aside from that, you know, we have some how-to videos. We have
33:13
um other options for um different language. We have we currently support
33:19
English and Spanish languages. That's on the dashboard side and the mobile app
33:25
side. And if your language is
33:32
on your operating system or your browser is already default Spanish, um it's
33:37
going to default to Spanish. If it's default English, it's going to default to English, but you can manually change
33:43
it if you would like to manually change those things. And so, aside from that, the only thing
33:49
I've really not gone over is um the sign up and the registration process. And so,
33:56
those things are pretty self-explanatory. I don't need to go over the nitty-gritty of them, but your
34:02
church does need to register on the website. And so, once the church is registered on the And this is pretty
34:09
important um concept to understand. Once the church has
34:16
registered on the website, then your church members can um
34:23
find your church when they um are doing the sign up process in the mobile app.
34:30
And so you need to make sure you go to go to the website the soulwinningapp.com and register.
34:36
And then once you've registered, you can begin directing church members to
34:43
download the mobile app. And they'll go to um you know, they can go to the
34:48
website and and download by by way of that or they can just go to the
34:57
app store on their phone.
35:05
and search for swap and download the soling
35:11
app onto their phone or swap's church app
35:16
um and then begin the sign up process that way.
35:22
So once they create their profile, which you know they'll they'll create
35:28
their profile, it'll send them a text, they'll they'll log in by way of a onetime password and then you know or
35:35
they can log in with their email if they want. It's a little more complicated in my opinion and just doing a onetime
35:41
password login. Once they get past that point, they're going to be prompted to
35:47
search for your church. And they can search for it by, you know, just searching for your name, the name of
35:52
your church. They know your zip code for your church address. They can type in the zip code for your church address and
35:59
see all the churches in the zip code there. Um, but you know, you you can search either or or both of them.
36:09
And you don't need to necessarily verbatim search the name of your church. And so, you know, if your church is, for
36:16
instance, Lake LA Baptist Church, you don't even have to search it the whole thing. You can just search Lake LA and
36:21
it'll it'll it'll bring that up. And so, um, pretty pretty easy stuff. But once
36:28
you know, you get past that registration and setup process and you're logged in, you're going to stay logged in all the
36:34
time. We we rarely ever do um crazy updates that constantly are logging your
36:40
church members out. Um but every once in a while, you know, there's there's necessary security updates that that
36:47
that do force us to do that, but it's very rarely. And so, um hopefully all of
36:54
this is uh useful and helpful. And like I mentioned, a lot of this is all just
36:59
uh training and test test data. A lot of the data in this um in these videos and
37:06
through these screen recordings have been just just dummy data. None of it's
37:11
been real. And a lot of this has just been for training purposes and for
37:17
AI documentation.

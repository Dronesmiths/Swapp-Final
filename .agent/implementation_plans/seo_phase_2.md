# Implementation Plan: SEO Keyword Optimization (Phase 2)

Consistent with the data provided from Search Console, we are focusing on "Intent Consolidation"—grouping keywords where users are searching for solutions (CRM, Attendance, Giving) and directing them to high-conversion pages (Pricing, Features).

## Phase 1: Navigation & Indexing (Immediate)
- [ ] **Fix Navigation Links**: Ensure "Pricing" is present in the global header/footer of `index.html`, `features/index.html`, and `free-church-app/index.html`.
- [ ] **Blog Index Update**: Add the "4 Pillars of a Strong Church App" to `/blog/index.html`.

## Phase 2: CRM & Feature Optimization
- [ ] **Group Management → Church CRM**: Modify `/features/group-management/index.html` to target "Best Church CRM for Small Churches" and "Church Database Software".
- [ ] **Visitor Intake → Lead Management**: Update `/features/new-visitor-intake/index.html` to include "Church Guest Follow Up System" keywords.

## Phase 3: Conversion & Internal Linking
- [ ] **Link to Pricing**: Add CTA sections to `/features/index.html` and `/free-church-app/index.html` that specifically mention "Affordable Church App Pricing" to capture cost-conscious searchers.
- [ ] **Footer Standardization**: Verify the "Ghost Section Killer" hasn't removed any intentional content and that the year is synced.

## Phase 4: Final Verification
- [ ] **Sitemap Check**: Confirm all 45+ pages are represented.
- [ ] **Browser Subagent Check**: Verify the live URLs for Pricing and the new Blog post.

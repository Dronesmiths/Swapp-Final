# Implementation Plan: SEO Keyword Optimization (Phase 2)

Consistent with the data provided from Search Console, we are focusing on "Intent Consolidation"—grouping keywords where users are searching for solutions (CRM, Attendance, Giving) and directing them to high-conversion pages (Pricing, Features).

## Phase 1: Navigation & Indexing (Immediate)
- [x] **Fix Navigation Links**: Ensure "Pricing" is present in the global header/footer of `index.html`, `features/index.html`, and `free-church-app/index.html`.
- [x] **Blog Index Update**: Add the "4 Pillars of a Strong Church App" to `/blog/index.html`.

## Phase 3: AI, Lead Management & CRM Content
- [ ] **Visitor Intake → Digital Guest Cards**: Modify `/features/new-visitor-intake/index.html` to target "Digital Church Guest Cards" and "Visitor Follow Up System".
- [ ] **Follow-Up → AI-Powered Workflows**: Update `/features/follow-up-and-outreach/index.html` with "AI-Driven Insights" and "Automated Church CRM".
- [ ] **New Blog Post**: Create `/blog/best-church-crm-for-small-churches-2026/index.html`.
- [ ] **Nav Standardization (Features sub-folders)**: Update header/footer in all feature subdirectories to match the main site.

## Phase 4: Final Verification
- [ ] **Sitemap Check**: Confirm all 45+ pages are represented.
- [ ] **Browser Subagent Check**: Verify the live URLs for Pricing and the new Blog post.

# SWAPP Agent Instructions

This document provides high-level instructions and context for AI agents working on the SWAPP (Soul Winning Application) ecosystem.

## Project Context
SWAPP is a comprehensive church management platform focused on outreach and evangelism.
- **Production Tech Stack**: Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Angular, React Native.
- **This Repository**: A static recreation of the marketing site (HTML/CSS/JS).

## Reference Materials
Before starting significant tasks, refer to the following documents in `.agent/knowledge/`:
- `project_overview.md`: Complete system architecture, features, and database schemas.
- `ai_roadmap.md`: The 2026 plan for AI integration across the platform.

## Key Principles
1. **Mission-Driven**: The software serves churches. Tone should be professional, helpful, and community-focused.
2. **AI-First (2026)**: We are currently in Phase 3 of the AI Roadmap (Outreach Maps AI). Consider how new features can leverage or showcase AI capabilities.
3. **Static vs. Production**: Distinguish between tasks meant for this static marketing site (HTML) and the production apps (Angular/Node/React Native).

## Workflows
Custom workflows are located in `.agent/workflows/`.

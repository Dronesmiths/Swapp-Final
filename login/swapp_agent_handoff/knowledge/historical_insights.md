# Historical Support Insights (Synthesized from Tidio)

This document summarizes the core patterns, solutions, and user behaviors identified in over 1,200 historical chat logs. These insights have been integrated into the `integrated_kb.md` and the public documentation page.

## 1. Mapping & Outreach Patterns
*   **Large-Scale Coordination**: Power users often struggle with "white space" between maps. The **Spiral Method** (starting at church and moving out) was the most requested advice for ensuring 100% saturation.
*   **Apartment Friction**: Users frequently find apartment complexes "daunting" if mapped as a single unit. The most effective strategy is splitting buildings into sub-routes.
*   **Pin Usage**:
    *   **Purple Pins**: Used for entry codes, office hours, and photos.
    *   **Red Pins**: Crucial for legal compliance (Do Not Knock) and member safety.

## 2. Technical Friction Points (F.A.Q.)
*   **The "Email Case" Issue**: Multiple logins failed because users capitalized their email on Desktop but not on Mobile (or vice versa). *System Fix: Remind users that email is case-sensitive.*
*   **Verification Latency**: Users often request a second link before the first arrives. *Advice: Wait 60 seconds and check Spam/Promotions.*
*   **Admin Permissions**: Sub-admins frequently lose access after app logouts. *Fix: Re-toggle role in Head Admin Dashboard.*
*   **Old Hardware Support**: Pre-2018 phones often crash when trying to render 1,000+ map polygons. *Solution: Print Map or Partner Mode.*

## 3. High-Value Roadmap Signals
*   **Searchability**: Users want to search the "List" by street name or house number directly.
*   **Bulk Actions**: Request for "Bulk Reset" of maps by folder rather than one by one.
*   **Team Messaging**: Interest in a more robust announcement system within the app feeds.

## 4. User Sentiment & Tone
*   Users respond best to "Ministry-focused" language rather than "Software-focused" language. Use terms like "Saturation," "Follow-up," and "Equipping" instead of "Data points" or "Users."

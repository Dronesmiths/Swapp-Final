# SWAPP Onboarding & Launch Video Plan

This plan focuses on the **"Zero to Launch"** journey for new churches. The goal is to provide 60-90 second tutorials that walk a Pastor or Admin through the initial setup process.

## 1. The Onboarding Journey (Core Series)

| Step | Title | Focus | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Registering Your Church** | Account Creation | Website search, registration, and initial login |
| **2** | **Brand Your App** | Organization Settings | Uploading Logo, setting up Giving links |
| **3** | **Building Your Geography** | Folders & Territories | Creating your first Folder (Section) and naming it |
| **4** | **Drawing Your First Map** | The Polyline Tool | Drawing a route, setting door counts, and saving |
| **5** | **Equipping the Team** | Member Onboarding | Referral codes, Role management (Admin vs Member) |
| **6** | **The Launch Day Experience** | Mobile Interaction | How members claim a map and check out |

## 2. Strategic "Deep-Dive" Setup
Detailed configuration for specific church needs:
*   **Customizing CRM Folders**: Setting up "Baptism," "VBS," or "Follow-up" buckets.
*   **QR Lead Capture**: Generating a folder-specific QR code for your welcome banner.
*   **Optimized Visit Routing**: Setting up a "Monday Visit" route from the CRM.

## 3. Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Admin Foundation (Desktop)
Focus on the web dashboard where the church is built.
*   *Registration -> Folder Setup -> Map Drawing.*

### Phase 2: Member Engagement (Mobile)
Focus on the experience for the soul winner on the street.
*   *Invite Code -> Finding Church -> Claiming Map.*

### Phase 2: Feature Deep-Dives
1.  **Apartment Strategies**
2.  **QR Code Lead Capture**
3.  **Optimized Service Routes**

### Phase 3: Placement
*   **Documentation.html**: Embed videos next to their relevant sections.
*   **Chat Agent**: I can now trigger these videos in my responses (e.g., "Would you like to watch a 1-minute video on mapping apartments?").
*   **Email Onboarding**: Include the "Dashboard Tour" in the initial welcome email.

## 4. Documentation Enhancements (Next Steps)
I can begin generating the "placeholder" markdown or HTML structures for these videos in `documentation.html` so you just have to drop in the YouTube/Vimeo ID when they are ready. 

**Decision Needed**: Do you prefer capturing these on Desktop (as the Admin) or Mobile (as the Member) first? Most support issues come from the **Mobile Member** experience.

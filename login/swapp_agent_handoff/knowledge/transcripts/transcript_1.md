All right. In this video, in this video, I'm going to thoroughly
0:08
go over all of the details of the software for the Soulwinning app. And
0:14
we've made with this software. We have developed this from just being a
0:20
door-to-door outreach and uh followup solution for churches to being a
0:27
complete package and platform that your church can use for ministry for um
0:35
engaging your members in a deeper connection with one another and then
0:41
communicating with your church members that you know the church staff can communicate better with the church members in a um useful way. And I think
0:52
the best and simplest way I could describe the software that we've built is that it was built by the church
1:00
and it is for the church. Compared to what most church software is out there,
1:05
it is built more geared towards the business side of
1:11
church and it's all staffheavy and requires a lot of staff or secretarial
1:16
input where versus what we've built is built more for the church member and the
1:23
more that is built in the appropriate ways for the church member, the the
1:28
easier it ends up being on the staff. um input side of things. And then you're
1:35
able to just use the the dashboard, the website, the the administration side of
1:41
the software as a
1:48
oversight of what is going on rather than trying to manually input everything
1:53
that is going on. So that's the goal with pretty much everything we built. anything that's future we build. Our
2:00
goal is to offload workloads on the staff side of things and not to put more
2:06
workloads on the member, but really to give the member the tools that the member often wants and needs to be
2:14
better engaged and involved with their church, with you, and um and also with
2:22
one another. better tools to uh build relationships with one another, grow
2:27
together. And so that's the purpose in a summary of what we build and why we
2:33
build it. And so I want to go ahead and dive into the fine details of everything
2:39
that is uh and makes up what we call, you know, swap, which stands for the
2:45
soulinning app and um how it works and what what its functionality is. So the
2:52
first thing you have to understand is there's two elements to this software and
2:59
there's the admin side of things and that's going to be done on the website. we call it the dashboard. And so you're
3:05
going to log into the website with your admin credentials. And um you're gonna you're going to be
3:13
able to have a good overview of everything that um is going on within
3:18
your church that you've registered on the app. You'll be able to, you know, put in maps for door-to-door outreach
3:25
maps, track what uh what's been done, what needs to be done, and all the details regarding that. You'll be able
3:32
to add contacts and use the CRM element of the software to further follow up
3:38
with people and engage with uh visitors or prospects or members or uh people
3:45
that um you know you as a church would need to follow up with um and um keep
3:52
records on. And so there will be there's uh you know check-ins and stuff
3:58
regarding those things. And then um you'll have outreach which is going to be um oh like I already mentioned the
4:06
maps and then you have ministries and that's going to be groups um within your mobile app and those
4:13
groups would be like Sunday schools or Sunday school classes or bus routes or
4:19
um or any type of smaller group setting that you're going to want uh in your
4:25
church. And that just helps you to better communicate to smaller groups the specific things that you would want to
4:31
communicate to the smaller group. Um and those are called ministries. Then we have uh routing which is another tool
4:38
for followup and um and and and further to be developed into bus routing for
4:43
those that uh that that want to use the that have bus routes and want to uh use
4:49
it for that purpose. And then we have events and so you can put all of your church calendar into this system. and
4:55
then also make available um separate you know events for just groups and
5:00
ministries. So if you want to just uh have particular um a subset of groups
5:06
for um subset of events for groups and ministries you'll be able to do that.
5:11
And then you have um just some other some other dashboard features that aren't necessarily core functions, but
5:18
you'll have um you know your up here you'll have your um in this
5:26
dashboard dropdown you'll have access to being able to see who uh has the app and
5:32
you'll be able to see who's downloaded the app and connected with your church and you'll be able to uh toggle their uh
5:39
roles and permissions uh uh for admin or not. You'll be able to see all of the check-ins and the records for that.
5:46
There's um prayers and so you'll be able to see the the prayer requests that are submitted to your church and um then
5:54
you'll also have uh you know a notification section. You'll also be able to see the whole
6:00
progress of all of the maps. And so what I want to do is uh take this video and I
6:05
want to run through every fine detail of the software. And so this is going to be
6:13
for multi-purpose. Um you know we'll be able to use this just for u detailed
6:19
documentation on the workings of the software and and how it works. We're
6:24
going to use this for the purpose of training videos and uh and and educating
6:29
how to um do things within the software. But there's a lot to this software and
6:36
most people aren't going to use every element of this. But we've made many features so that um everything is there
6:43
that a church might want to use and or we're building building into it still.
6:50
Um and so let me dive into this and um run through these details the the other
6:58
side of things. Um so I that was I guess a brief overview
7:04
brief but thorough overview of the dashboard. The other side of the
7:09
software is the mobile app. So the mobile app is uh what your church member
7:17
or your staff member is going to use u to interact with your church's system.
7:26
And so they'll they will download the app, create a profile, connect with
7:33
your church, and then begin engaging with what you've made available to them
7:39
to begin engaging with. And that's going to be all of the functionality of the app uh with some some special privileges
7:46
made available to some of the your team or church members that you've given
7:51
admin privileges to. And so we'll go over all of those details and and the workings of those and then how these two
7:59
uh work together and cross-pollinate and um and so let me start by running
8:06
through the outreach features of the app
8:11
and the
8:17
which is going to be the uh outreach maps. So the outreach maps are going to
8:22
be used by you for the purpose of um maybe going doortodoor or doing
8:30
um
8:35
solicitation for um maybe some surveys that you're
8:41
taking in in your neighborhood or whatever you might do for the purpose of doortodoor. There's some churches doing
8:48
uh prayer campaigns where you're just going house to house and praying for people or asking for prayer requests,
8:54
you know, whatever whatever kind of twist that you've kind of done to to do a door-to-door campaign. These maps will
9:01
facilitate that uh and help you to be able to give the tools you'll want to
9:06
them uh give these uh and give the the ability to engage with this outreach
9:14
method. um in a really easy fashion and also a really organized and cohesive fashion.
9:21
And so uh you'll go to the outreach section on the dashboard and then uh you
9:26
know if this is your first time coming here, the browser is going to ask you uh to allow permission to know your
9:34
location. This is just a Google Maps thing. So you can you can say allow
9:39
while visiting the site. You can say never allow and and that would be okay, but don't expect it to know where you're
9:45
at and pull up a map uh close to where you're at. You'll need to click on this
9:51
search um in in the Google Maps view and uh search your location and pull it up.
9:57
And then guess what? Google knows where you're at anyway. So um don't be too paranoid about the knowing your
10:03
location. So then um what you'll want to do is
10:10
um the first thing once you're in this outreach section is um you'll need to be
10:16
in the map view. There is two views. There's the map view of all of your
10:21
outreach maps and then there's the list view of all of your outreach maps. And
10:26
so you're going to be creating your outreach maps on the map view. And so
10:32
make sure you're there. That is the default view. If you click over to outreach anyways, you'll need to uh
10:38
manually toggle it over to the list view to switch over to that view and see the the details of those. But I'll show you
10:44
that next. So once you're into the map view um of the outreach section, you'll
10:51
want to uh click on the add a folder button. Once you click on the add a folder button,
11:00
you'll see your cursor uh when hovering over the map will change from the normal
11:06
cursor to the little plus indicating that it's ready for you to start drawing
11:13
this folder or territory. So, we call them folders just kind of because of the
11:19
legacy paper idea of doing outreach with paper maps. Um, but really they're
11:24
territories or zones that you're going to section off your town. And so, you
11:31
know, I'll draw you one real quick here. How you draw these uh territories is
11:37
find where you're going to be and then you click to drop your first anchor point. And then, um, you'll just keep to
11:44
draw around the territory you want. You just click to keep dropping anchor points to draw the shape that you want
11:51
to draw around that territory. When you're done, you'll want to come full
11:57
circle back to that first anchor point. And you'll notice it'll kind of snap to that first anchor point a little bit,
12:04
and the cursor will change from a plus back to the finger. Uh it might be a
12:09
little different depending on the uh computer you're on, but then click again on that last that first anchor point.
12:16
When you come full circle, it'll pop up with a Adam, you know, a how to name
12:23
it it'll prompt you then with a window. It'll pop up and ask you to name this
12:28
territory. So name the territory. Since I'm just showing you how to do this, I'm going to name this test
12:37
test test- one. And so give a good name to your uh uh your territories and your
12:44
folders for your outreach maps. Um youll want to give them um
12:52
a simple naming struct structure. You can do something like north, south, east, or west. And if that doesn't work
12:57
in your town, you can uh name it in in a way that either your your people in your
13:04
church would understand or just something more systematic. You can just be zone A, zone B, zone C, whatever you
13:12
want to do. But give it a name because then once you give it this name, what I do, what I'll re, you'll see why we'll
13:18
name it uh maybe something a little more systematic when it comes to the naming of the streets. So you can you can
13:25
change the color of the territory if you'd like to change
13:32
the color of the territory. This color picker is different on different browsers. Uh to be honest, I don't like
13:39
the color picker of the Chrome browser, but um but you can um do the color picker.
13:47
Uh you can change that color if you want. If you just leave it default, it's gonna um um
13:56
that's okay. You can just leave it default. So, we'll go ahead and save that.
14:01
And you'll notice even though I had on it um to be black, it shows up red. You
14:09
say, "Oh, that must be a a problem." No, that's not a problem. It's showing red
14:14
because there are no available maps in this territory that we just created. We
14:20
need to put some available maps in this territory. Once we put the available
14:25
maps in this territory, um this
14:30
territory will turn its default color again. Red is the default when you've
14:36
completed all of the maps in this territory or there's no maps in this territory. So, let me click on this
14:42
territory on the map. That that polygon we just drew. That territory we just
14:47
drew. We can click on it on the map. You can also click on it on the sidebar over on the left hand side. You'll see the
14:55
name of all of the territories you just made. You could also click on it that way and it will open up that territory.
15:02
Once you click on it, you'll see there are three new little icons on the center, the top center of the Google
15:12
Maps view. And so we're going to click on the button that looks like another polygon shape and then uh that's also
15:21
says add a map. There's another one that just looks like a pin and it says add a
15:26
marker. And then there's the other one that just takes us back out of this view and shows us all the folders again, not
15:32
just this one folder or territory. So, I'm going to click on the add a map
15:38
button. Let me zoom in. Oops.
15:44
If you mess up, that's okay. You can always just end the map
15:49
and then just close it. So, or reload the page. So, let me zoom
15:55
in real quick. And and if it does help you, you can switch on the satellite view.
16:03
Some areas satellite view is a little more helpful. Um, and the more rural the
16:09
more rural areas you get, satellite view becomes more helpful because the houses don't show up until you're way too
16:15
zoomed in to see much. So, um,
16:21
let's click on the add a map again. And then we're just going to do we're going to create this map in a similar way that
16:29
we just created the folder. You'll see you'll have a new plus indicating that you can draw the map and click to drop
16:37
the first anchor point to start the map and then
16:43
click to drop the other anchor point. And the maps that I'm drawing here are very
16:50
straight. If your streets are not straight. That's
16:55
okay. Um, all you'll do is just keep clicking just like we did with the territory. At
17:03
every point, you want to drop an anchor point to draw along the street.
17:08
And once you've done that, you come to the last anchor point. And
17:15
I'll drop that last anchor point. And then I will click that same spot again.
17:22
That will end the drawing of that map. And so once that happens, I will give it
17:29
a name. It will pop up with a window and ask for the the name for that map. And
17:34
we will just name it T1 for test. Since we made it uh we named
17:41
the folder a test- one folder. Um I I'm going to name this
17:47
folder T-1. And then I'm going to hit enter.
17:54
And then I'm going to click on the add a map button again. And I'm going to draw a map again.
18:01
And you'll find once you get going,
18:08
it's real easy to just uh continue to repeat that process because once you
18:17
once you go to create the next map, it remembers the sequence that you did for
18:22
the last map. And so when I go to name test map two or test map three, all I
18:29
got to do is um erase the two and put a three.
18:36
And then for the next one, I will just erase the three
18:44
and put the four. So now we have test map one, test map two, test map three,
18:50
test map four. Uh real quick and easy. It's real easy to make some maps once you get going. And like I mentioned, if
18:56
you're doing curved streets, you'll just click and then click to drop the other
19:03
anchor point and then click again if you need to follow a real curved road. It
19:11
still isn't that much harder. And you'll uh finish out the map the same way.
19:17
And save. You can push enter to save those maps. a little easier than moving the mouse
19:24
around every time to click the enter button on the popup window. So once you've done that,
19:32
you'll notice once you make a map, there will be a new icon that shows up in the center, the top center of the map next
19:40
to the other add a map button, the add a marker button, and the show all folder
19:45
buttons. This one will say show map name buttons. And so this is just a toggle to
19:51
hide or reveal the names of those maps that we just made. And you'll see once
19:56
we show them, we'll see the T1, the T2, T3, T4, T5. And then we can hide those.
20:03
So they're not always there. Sometimes they those uh those bubbles kind of get in the way if if you leave them in the
20:09
way. So they're by default they're off. And so
20:17
all right. So once you've done that, um, all of this mapping data
20:25
shows up in a very similar way on the mobile app. And so if I hop over to the
20:30
mobile app, which I have pulled up over here, and um, open it to the home
20:38
screen, the home screen is going to show by default the prayers that have been submitted. And if there's been no
20:45
prayers submitted in your church, it's just going to be empty and blank. Uh you can put something there. But um let me
20:52
hop over to the outreach tab. And that's on the bottom, the next one right next to the home tab.
20:59
So that's uh we'll click on that outreach tab on the bottom
21:05
and it'll show the maps we previously had in this account uh in this church
21:10
account and those new maps we just made available. And if I click on that territory just like I do on the
21:17
dashboard side, it'll reveal those maps that we just created inside that test uh
21:23
one folder. And if I want, I can zoom in and look at them closer.
21:32
And I can click on that map. And if this is the map, you know, after
21:38
I've clicked on it, I get a little popup window that'll say view this street or cancel. And it'll give me the name of
21:45
the street, uh, that custom name. I'm looking at test number four. And it
21:50
currently says no checkins. So, if this has been checked into previously and
21:56
completed previously, it'll tell me who did it and when they did it. And so, if
22:02
this was some something relatively recent and for some reason I'm looking at it, it says yesterday somebody did
22:08
this, but yet it's still made available or green. Um, then you know that would
22:14
that that should u that's there just for a quick visual reference. So after we see this popup
22:22
real quick, we'll just click on that view street. And this gives us the more detailed view of this this one map. And
22:30
so there's a little check box on the bottom right. This gives us all of the things that we can do to this map or
22:38
while we're viewing this map. If I want to go do this map, what I'm going to do is check into this map. So I'm going to
22:44
check in. And what I've now done is I've just said I have taken and claimed this
22:52
map. So I'm now going to what I'm as a church member, what I'm saying is I'm
22:57
going to go to this street, I'm going to knock these doors and I'm going to complete this map. And
23:06
as I as I go to this map, once I get here and I'm walking up and down this
23:12
street, you would see my little blue dot where I was on the street, my location
23:17
information. And of course, the member, the user, your church member is going to have to allow that while they're using the app so they can see where they're at
23:24
on this street. And then if they were standing in front of a particular house,
23:31
you know, once you're zoomed in far enough, you can see the houses or you can switch to the satellite view again
23:36
on the mobile app side of things. And while they're checked in here and
23:42
they're standing in front of a house, if they met somebody at this house that was interested or was worth notating for
23:50
some reason or there's a particular spot here that um you know that depending on
23:55
what kind of campaigns you're doing, what what you're doing with your outreach uh maps, you would you know
24:01
that you've instructed them to save contacts or pins uh accordingly. and
24:07
they're they're uh you know there seems to be some sort of interest at this house. They can click on the house.
24:15
They'll easily be able to identify that because their blue dot will be standing right in front of that house and they
24:20
can click the contact button. That contact button will drop um what they're
24:26
doing is they're adding a contact into the system. And so somebody's interested
24:31
and they'll get a contact form or a prospect form or whatever you want to call this. They'll uh be prompted with a
24:38
window. They'll need to just kind of confirm the house numbers correct before moving on to the prospect form. And then
24:45
um they'll put in the details of that contact. And the only necessary
24:52
details to save this contact is the first name. And many times when you're
24:57
going door to door, that might be all you get. Um if if it's uh somebody that
25:03
you know is maybe moderately you sense is maybe moderately interested and maybe worth following up with. But but there
25:09
are many times you'll get some more information if it's a good contact and you can fill that information out. But
25:16
the only thing required is a first name. So let me put a
25:22
put a name in here. Test John.
25:28
So, we got test John in here. We put a first and last name. And you can put notes in here
25:35
to um to add some more details about this that
25:42
maybe aren't conforming to the form, you know, like the email, the phone number,
25:47
uh the date of birth, the gender, the marital status, some of that other uh other details that are in that form. If
25:53
there's something that's not um in that form that you want to put in, you can just put some notes in here, talk to the
26:00
person, you know, it was a really good conversation, they're interested in coming to church or they're interested
26:06
in uh being baptized as they were saved recently or whatever, whatever the notes
26:11
that you want to put into, you know, the members want to put in here, they can be put in here. We'll put baptism
26:18
because I'll show you kind of what you can do with these notes on the dashboard side of things later.
26:24
And so once we put that note in there and that contact, we'll hit save. And
26:29
you'll be able to see that pin instantly on that map. And so
26:34
right there at that house I clicked on, there's a green pin and it has the first
26:40
name of that contact pin there. And there's some other pins that you can drop. And so if they keep going along
26:46
and they uh meet, you know, tap on a house again, they can pull up that same
26:53
uh window that gives you the ability to click on the contact pin. But there are three other categories of pins. There's
27:00
the do not knock pin. There's the no one home pin or the add a note pin. And so
27:07
those those are more just identifiers, quick identifiers. So if you meet
27:13
somebody and it's like Maybe this house burned down. I don't I don't know. Or what uh they said, "Don't
27:18
ever come back again or I'm going to shoot you." Or some something wild like that. You can flag that as a do not
27:24
knock to respect them for not uh coming back again. And then maybe you can use that um that data for a mailer later on
27:32
and then uh mail them or something else. And so you can add that do not knock pin
27:37
or you can add a u no one home. And some of these pins um
27:45
become a little more useful in more rule settings where you're not knocking on uh
27:51
thousands and thousands and thousands of doors, but maybe you're only knocking on
27:56
a couple hundred and you're driving from house to house to house um as you're
28:01
trying to meet everybody in the rural areas. And so that's what some of these other pins are for, the no one home.
28:08
you're not going to want to flag no one home on highly congested areas as it just it it clutters it's just too much
28:15
data and so we do not recommend doing that that type of an approach um in more
28:21
congested areas and so um I'll I'll show you just for sake of this if I click on the no one home pin you'll get another
28:28
color pin that that uh shows no one home and I can click on it and it
28:34
tells me that's a no one home pin I can Click on the other pin. It says it's a do not knock pin. And then we can click
28:41
on the other pin again. And this one is a note pin. So if it's something custom
28:46
that I need to add for some reason, I can uh type in any custom details about
28:51
this pin and I can just type away. And then I can also upload a picture to this
28:58
pin uh for for reference regarding that. And so uh show you just for sake of it
29:06
test note and we drop that pin and it's going to
29:12
show a purple purple pin.
29:35
All right. So once we have completed this map, you will want to instruct your
29:46
you'll want to instruct your church members uh to make sure that they check out
29:56
of this map. And this will flag this will mark this
30:02
map as complete. And so you'll notice as I've checked into this map that it has
30:09
turned from the green default color for which means available to the yellow
30:16
meaning it's being worked on. It's checked into. And if I
30:24
um reload the dashboard, since I have the dashboard and these same maps pulled back up, you'll see if I click on those
30:32
areas, you'll see that one map I checked into here is yellow. The other ones that we made are green. And so, um before I
30:41
check out, there is a few other buttons on that, uh expandable check box on the
30:48
bottom. um where that we previously used to check in to this map with there is a
30:55
a button for navigation. This gives your members the ability to get turnbyturn
31:01
directions to this map if they need turnbyturn directions to that map and it'll take them over to their to their
31:09
uh default um
31:15
maps app on their phone and give them turnbyturn directions to it. they'll need to switch back over to this app to
31:21
continue to interact with um with the the soulwinning app, the swaps system
31:27
for the outreach side of things. But um that button is there. There is a notes
31:33
in a history button. And if I click on that, it'll pull me up any notes that
31:39
have been added to this map. and I'll be able to see the note the note pin
31:44
details, but I'll also be able to see the note pin pictures here and also uh
31:51
there's a history section of that. So, I'll be able to see um all the history
31:57
of check-ins on this map. And so I'll be
32:02
able to see when it was completed last, you know, if it's uh if this map has
32:07
been created many, many years ago and you guys have worked this system for a
32:13
long time and you've been able to go back through your town a couple times, you'll be able to see all of the records on that uh forever. And so there's that
32:22
that button and then there's also the um satellite view. There's two ways to
32:29
switch to the satellite view. There's one inside this menu and then there's the default little icon on the outside
32:36
on the top left corner of the Google Maps view. And then there's uh another
32:43
button that says share URL. So, if I have a if I'm going out doortodoor with
32:48
a group of people or somebody else and I want to get them on the same map as me
32:54
without having to navigate into the app, try to find the same map um in the view
33:03
that you know both try to find the same map. one person can check into it and
33:08
then they can share that URL with the other person and then just click on it via text or something and then it'll
33:14
take them right into the app if they have the app downloaded and connected with your church and right into this map
33:22
and um that'll get two people onto the same map
33:28
u and so there's that that functionality also.
33:34
So, but once we are done with this map as a
33:40
um door knocker or somebody that's um going out, I'm going to click on the
33:46
check out button on that expandable menu on the bottom right that check box.
33:54
And it's going to prompt me and ask me for how many doors did I knock. And so
33:59
you'll want to make sure to instruct your church members to um you know at
34:05
least, you know, maybe count their tracks or or guess how many doors they did or count
34:11
it when they check out. Um and um you can also indicate how many doors are on
34:18
this map if you'd like so that they don't have to count it. They can just if they did them all, they can just look at
34:23
that number and know um that all of these
34:29
uh all the doors were done and so they just put in the full number. And so I'm just going to put one
34:36
since I didn't actually go do this map. But you'll likely want to do probably like maps that are about the size of 30
34:44
to um 60 doors depending on how congested they are and what the
34:50
demographics of where you're knocking are. So once I've put the number of doors, I'll click the check out button.
34:58
And when I click the check out button, it's going to turn that map from yellow
35:04
since it was being worked on to red, meaning it is now complete. And so, um,
35:12
on the dashboard side of things, if I also reload that, I'll be able to see it over there. But it does also instantly
35:18
reflect on the mobile app. So, your members will be able to see also as they
35:23
work their way through your town. you'll all be able to see the progress of what
35:29
you're working on. And so that that also helps motivate people and be a little more inspired that, you know, there's a
35:36
lot of order to this and I I can be engaged in this because there's there's there's some more there's there, you
35:43
know, it's organized and um you know, you guys aren't out there just double knocking and knocking uh you know, the
35:51
same little block this you know, 10 times over and frustrating people. So you're
35:57
you're organized, cohesive, and um and
36:03
re logging and recording important information along the way. So it does help uh motivate people. And then you
36:10
also give them the tools that they need to be able to easily um
36:17
engage in this ministry you might have in your church, but also add notes and
36:23
contacts. And um when these tools are made easily available to them, you'll
36:28
find that um that many will als will will want to uh add contacts so that
36:35
they can be followed up with whether you encourage them to follow up with those people or uh or you know you you're okay
36:42
with sending uh other people back. Um if if you've trained them to do it one way or the other, that's that's perfectly
36:49
fine. however you've um you know kind of worked that into your outreach system or
36:54
your plan or your goals. So um but making those tools available and that visual progress available to them can be
37:01
inspiring and motivating them to be more engaged and more involved in that. So if
37:08
I reload the dashboard like I've done and I look at that same territory, I'll
37:14
see that one completed map that I just did. So that is the functionality
37:21
of the um the doortodoor maps. Okay.
37:30
And how it functions across the whole platform. Now there's also the list
37:35
details. So, if you want to get into once you've created some maps and you want to be able to look at them in a
37:43
little bit different of a fashion, not just on a map, um the list view is where you're
37:49
going to see the details of every map. So if I click on the the um the for instance the
37:56
map in the list view that I just created
38:02
the test number four or sorry that I just completed that's red. You'll notice
38:07
that on the uh the list view it'll show the uh the little red toggle meaning
38:13
that that one's been toggled off or it's it's red you know it's not available for
38:18
door knocking and Um, if I click on that, I can see all of
38:25
the details on that right hand column of, you know, I can get a quick little view
38:31
of it on a small little map view. I can see the total door count, the
38:36
total number of knocks, the check-ins, the house pins, and then I have a
38:42
another section down in the bottom with uh some separate tabs, and I can see the
38:47
details of every check-in. I can see all the contact pins that were added on this
38:53
map. Can see the test John contact that we added. And we can see the house pins
39:02
that we uh we added that do not knock the no
39:08
one home. We can see the note pins that we added and we can also see the um
39:15
appointments. So appointments are um if I have shared this map with one of
39:24
the mobile app users or the members and so I can do that. You'll notice there's
39:29
a little share button right next to this um
39:35
this map uh on the center column where it lists um you know test number four
39:42
that initial map item we clicked on on the list. There's a little three dots that are connected with a line
39:49
indicating the share. So, if we click on that little share button, it will
40:06
bring us up a list of all of the church members that are um connected with the
40:12
uh with our church. And um and I can just click share and it'll share that
40:17
map with that church member. And then that church member will get a
40:23
notification that we've shared a um you know a map, we've shared an an outreach
40:29
map with them. And if they click on that notification, it'll take them to their appointment section where they'll be
40:35
able to see those outreach maps that you've um maybe designated directly to
40:41
them. And so that's that's a way that you can get maps to them, too. if you want to be really um particular with
40:48
where certain people are going, uh that's an option that you can you can use. And so that'll show up in that
40:43
appointments tab uh on the far right column.
40:58
And then you'll also see another button, there's two buttons. There's an edit button for this map and I can edit the
41:04
details of this map. the door, you know, how many doors are on it, the name of it, and whether or
41:11
not it's open or closed is what I can uh change on this view uh on this edit. And
41:19
so there's also a print button. So, I can print this map out into a PDF and
41:25
you can hand this this map to somebody if there's people in your church that
41:30
don't want to use the mobile app or maybe they're older or they don't even have a phone or the ability to use a
41:37
mobile app. Um, you you have this feature available and
41:42
so this works really well. And what I also recommend doing in this as you
41:47
start out with this system is don't really even try to introduce the mobile
41:53
app too much because it does complicate it and trying to onboard people with the mobile app. What I would recommend if
41:59
you're just trying to use the outreach side of things for starters, just start
42:05
with printing maps. So create some maps and some territories, maybe come up with a plan um and and then create a few maps
42:13
and then print those maps off and just hand those paper maps out and say, "Hey, you know, this is where we're going.
42:19
This is where you can go and what you can do." And then begin slowly easing into the mobile app. As those that have
42:26
a phone, you're going to find will much prefer to engage with this system with a
42:33
phone rather than continuing to receive paper because the paper is limited than
42:39
in um in its ability to um have the freedom to engage and follow up with
42:46
people and have the tools for, you know, being more effective. And so there's there's people that will want to be on
42:52
board with the mobile app side of it, but you'll always have those people that aren't and that's why we've made the uh
42:57
printing function available. You can print individually by clicking on that
43:02
map and then clicking that print button or you can select the checkbox next to a
43:09
group of maps. And so each map on the line item for the list is going to it'll
43:14
have a little select box next to it. So you can select multiple maps and then
43:19
you'll have a little icon that'll show up. you actually have a couple icons that show up. You'll have a print icon.
43:26
You can click on that to print those three maps that we've just selected. Um, and then you have some other icons
43:32
that showed up. I can delete, there's a delete button. I can delete all three of these maps. Um, and then I can also
43:39
share all three of these maps with somebody like we had previously gone over with, but in a bulk setting. And
43:46
then there's also a little folder looking icon. And so um that will allow
43:52
you to move those three contacts into a particular folder and we'll go over that in a second and what that means.
44:00
And so if
44:06
there's one other option you can do with bulk um selecting maps and that is to
44:11
change the status of these three maps and so or or how many other maps that I
44:17
select. If I change the status of these three to
44:24
open, which two of them were open already, one of them wasn't, it moves them all to
44:31
open. And that test number four, since that was one of the ones that we had selected and completed, you'll notice
44:37
that it changed from red back to green. And so, if I select these three again,
44:45
I can toggle them back all over to close. or not back over to close, but I can
44:52
toggle them closed. And so you can also just individually do that on individual
44:57
maps if you want. There's that little green and red toggle. And so I can just switch over one of those and it'll
45:03
toggle that one to green or or red. So it's really easy to update this. And the
45:10
purpose of this is once you go through your town, you know, in theory, they're all going to be red and you're going to
45:16
want to move them back over to green to make them all available again. Uh so
45:21
that you can um work back through your town if that's you know the goals of your outreach method. And so
45:38
before I move on from this bulk feature, I want to mention one other thing. If
45:43
you select more than five maps and then try to print them, it won't work. So the limit
45:51
of bulk printing is limited to five maps. And so, um, and that's that's just
45:57
a limitation beyond our our, uh, capabilities. That's something that it's
46:03
just that's just a Google limitation that, um, they won't let us, um, you
46:09
know, pull more than that. And so, you're limited to five. And so, if you need to um, print more
46:17
than that, then you'll just have to sit down and do it five by five. But um I would challenge you to just um print
46:24
what you need on a weekly basis. That that helps you keep a little bit better record of um what you've done and as
46:32
you've worked through it, the time the timeline it's taken you to work through it. Um and you'll have some more digital
46:39
records for that. Once you print off a map, just keep in mind it also does mark the map complete.
46:47
And so for all of the digital system is concerned once the map exits its exits
46:54
the system it has to assume that it's complete. And so you'll you'll just want
46:59
to make sure that that map gets complete and then you can just throw it away and
47:04
know that the system has already logged it as complete and and it'll have a a
47:10
completed method. it'll have a completed date on it uh from the date that you
47:15
printed it out and it'll say that you've uh done it by way of the kiosk.
47:21
So, another thing to keep note of is if you
47:28
are printing a map and it's your first time printing a map, you will want to
47:34
make sure that um you allow the popup
47:39
when you go to print the map. And so, there may be a little popup, a browser notification or something that will uh
47:46
prompt you to allow popups. And so if you don't allow those popups, you're not
47:51
going to be able to print the map out. And so that popup um is going to be necessary to uh to be able to print the
47:59
map. So make sure you allow the popups so that it'll open up that map in
48:05
another tab and you'll be able to see that PDF and just print that PDF right to your uh printer. So, moving on from
48:13
here, over on that far lefthand column, you're going to see um
48:20
the list of your folders. And if you haven't created any folders
48:26
yet, there's not going to be a list of folders there. And so, in a similar way, just the same
48:32
the same interface that we saw over with the outreach uh maps and the the viewport way. Um,
48:40
sorry the um, sorry I kind of lost track of where I
48:46
was. Ignore that section of all of this. Moving over to the left hand column,
48:54
we have a similar view over here that we saw over on the map
49:02
view of the outreach maps. And so we can see the folders on the lefth hand column
49:07
the same way in that list form. We have you know the ones the folders we have in this account previously which were a
49:15
central folder, a southwest folder, a northwest folder, a northeast folder and then we have that test one folder that
49:21
we made. And um I can click on each one of these folders and see the maps that
49:28
are in this folder over here in that center column with the list view. And
49:33
you can see the ones in this folder are all completed. And and I can there's two
49:39
buttons on this folder. I can there's a edit button on the left hand
49:47
side um more centered than uh then there's
49:53
also a delete button. If I click on that edit button, it will allow me to rename
49:58
this folder. But I also have the option to turn this folder or this territory
50:04
off in the app. And it just says visibility on the app. And so if I turn
50:10
the visibility in the app off now, when I reload the mobile app, that that
50:16
territory won't show up at all. And so if you need a um kind of if you have a
50:21
bunch of territories available but you want to only make certain area available for outreach because you want to focus
50:28
on that, you can turn all the other ones off and and bring in the focus so that your your outreach is more focused in.
50:36
And um and and so that's there if you needed if if you needed to be there. And
50:42
um and then of course there's the rearrange
50:49
folder button. This will give you the ability to kind of move these folders up and down if you have a priority list of
50:54
which ones you prefer to be up top just in your list. And then there's the all outreach list.
51:02
And so this just brings you back to the list of everything. And so of course out
51:08
of all of this stuff there's a search. And so if you need to find a particular map name, you can search through that
51:14
and find those maps. And let me take you back over to the map
51:20
view. There's one other thing I forgot to show you in uh inside this view for
51:27
the outreach maps and that is the
51:33
the edit button on the folder from here. So, similar to what I just showed you
51:39
over there, if I click on the edit button on that list on the lefth hand column, I I have a few different options
51:47
for editing the folder on the map view than I do on the list view. The map
51:52
view, I have a map view of this folder. So, the territory that I drew out, um, I
51:59
can see this territory drawn out on this map here that on this popup window that came up. And if I want to redraw this
52:07
territory, I can click this erase button and erase the territory and redraw the
52:13
territory. This allows me to, you know, leave all of these maps that are in this folder and not have to just delete the
52:20
whole folder, recreate the folder, and then try to remove the maps back in that folder. You can just redraw this
52:26
territory, maybe to take up a little bigger section and then add some more maps into it or whatever you need to do
52:32
um for that. And so you can also change the color of this territory u since you
52:38
can visualize the colors here and you have the same option um here also that
52:43
you had on the map view. You can rename it and you can also turn the visibility in the app off. And then you also right
52:52
next to that edit folder you have the delete folder. And keep in mind as you're deleting folders you're not going
52:59
to delete the maps that are in this folder. And so for instance, if I delete
53:05
this test one map that we made, delete
53:11
in the map view, I have no way to view those individual maps that we put
53:17
because now that folder is gone. And so I have no way to bring those maps up and look at them. Um, but if I go over to
53:25
the list view, you'll still see them right at the top there because those were the last maps we created. I would
53:31
need to if I want to delete these maps, I actually need to delete the map um
53:38
before deleting the you know folder. If we want to do it in the the map view,
53:43
but it you know if I want to just delete them here, I can come over to um over to
53:49
here and delete those test maps that we made and permanently get rid of them and
53:56
they are gone. And so another quick thing to uh notate over on the map view
54:02
is if I open if I'm have a territory opened and I can see all the maps in
54:09
that territory, I can also click on that individual map and it comes up with that
54:15
same popup window that I could that I had when I was editing the um folders.
54:25
And I can erase this map and redraw this map. I can change the status of this
54:31
map. And then I can also uh rename it or this is also where I can add the number
54:37
of doors that are on this individual map. And so um the default that it adds
54:43
when you create it is just one door. if you want to actually change that that you can come in and and edit that um
54:52
default number from one to something else. So,
55:01
close that out. And
55:07
before we move on from outreach maps, let me show you one other feature. And
55:14
this isn't in the outreach tab on the dashboard. This is actually in the dropdown the dashboard dropdown section
55:23
on the dashboard. And so I can click on the top, you know, all of these menus are on the top section of the the
55:32
website. You have the dashboard, you know, um on the far
55:38
left, and then you have the contacts next to that and the outreach next to that. And those are all on that top top
55:45
menu section. So if I click on that dashboard dropdown, there'll be those options I explained earlier, but
55:52
I'll be able to um click on this see progress option. The see progress shows
55:58
me all of the individual maps that we have created inside this uh inside our
56:05
church. And it doesn't show the territories because when you're in the other view, you can only see one. You
56:12
can only see all the maps inside one territory at a time. This gives you the ability to see all the maps in all the
56:18
territories at one time. See which ones are red, which ones are yellow, and which ones are green. And you can toggle
56:26
the names on and off here. And then you can also see them. There's a a total
56:32
number of doors knocked. There's a counter on this view. So if you want to um see how many doors that your church
56:38
has knocked, you'll be able to see that. um
56:43
from here. And so from here uh I want to move on to contacts.
56:49
And so contacts blends partially with outreach. And so um let's move on to
56:55
contacts from here. And we're going to make this in a a few different segments of videos. And so this next video I'm
57:02
going to um move over to contacts.

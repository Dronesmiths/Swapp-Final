All right, this next video, like I mentioned, we're going to be working our way through the contacts
0:06
uh feature. And this basically would be like a CRM for your church.
0:14
Um in the traditional way to ter, you know, word things. Um this is really for
0:20
managing a contact database where you need to keep members records or um
0:28
you know people that are in your church. Uh you know, children's
0:34
um records and details
0:39
and it also integrates very well with the um door-to-door mapping system that's
0:46
built into the soulwinning app. And so let me give you a overview of how the
0:53
whole system functions and then every detail within the system about what you
0:59
can do with contacts and
1:09
how you can use this in a practical way in your church. So, the first thing to remember that we've
1:16
uh already covered in a really basic way is how we were able to add contacts
1:23
while we were checked into a map going doortodoor. And so, this this works
1:29
and integrates with the doortodoor mapping so that you can more easily generate leads or get contact
1:35
information for people that you can work on and follow up. And it makes your doortodoor outreach efforts a little
1:42
more um data driven so that you can follow up with those contacts. And that's a really important capability so
1:49
that you um are organized and can facilitate followup and building the
1:54
relationships with people so that
2:00
you can continue to win them um and witness to them
2:07
accordingly. you know, and so
2:15
how that brings over to now as we look at the contact interface is
2:21
the individual user that added the contact when they were going doortodoor,
2:29
they will notice in their contacts list. And so if if um if I click on the little
2:37
contacts option on the bottom navigation um
2:44
option on the mobile app, there's a little contacts button right after the
2:49
events. So you have the home button, you have the outreach button, you have the events button, and then you have the
2:54
contacts, and then you have the ministries button. And so if I click on that contacts button on the navigation
3:01
bar on the mobile app, I will be shown all of the contacts that I have
3:11
added in my you know that that I have interacted
3:17
with as an individual. So, this would be somebody that I have met doortodoor or
3:23
somebody that I've been shared a contact with to follow up with and I've um added
3:29
follow-up notes and I've interacted with them in some way. Once I've interacted with them, they will show up in my list.
3:36
I can continue to further follow up with these individuals um or not.
3:44
And so that one that I added uh while I was doortodoor, you'll notice it on my
3:50
list here, the test John. And I can see all the details that I added. And if I
3:56
want to see the notes that I added on here, you notice baptism. Remember that note that I added when we saved that
4:02
contact, there's a little baptism note there. It tells me when the note was added and then any pictures um that are
4:10
added with that note um can also be done. And so if I pull up his contact card info, um, I see all of those
4:17
details. So I can see where he's at on a map. I can see a
4:24
there's a navigate button which will take me, you know, give me turnbyturn directions to that to his house, to his
4:31
address. And then there's a record visit button. This will give me the option if I want to add additional notes and
4:38
record a visit or just record some more information about this contact, I can click the record a visit button and then
4:45
the rest of the details show up uh below in this contact card information. So,
4:51
there's some um information. You know, the most important information you're probably going to want to be able to see
4:56
is up top, which would be, you know, an email address if he has one,
5:03
a phone number if he has one, his address, and then uh, you know, you have
5:08
that notes icon. So, the notes history, and you can click on that and see his notes. If I want to send him an email
5:13
and there's an email in in his records, um I can click on the little icon and
5:20
it'll take me right to uh compose an email and send an email to him. And the
5:26
same with the phone number. If I want to send a phone, I can click on this little send an SMS message and it'll take me
5:31
right over to my messaging app and start a uh start to compose a message that I
5:37
can send to him. The same with the phone number. If I click on the phone number, it'll ask me if I want to call his number and will take me right to my
5:44
phone app so I can give him a call. And then if I want to see some of the other
5:50
information about his contact details, I'll click on the little expandable gener general information button. So
5:57
there's a little plus right next to general information at the bottom of his contact card. And I can see all of the
6:04
other things about him. date of birth, gender, you know, his status and then,
6:09
you know, his contact status and then his marital marital status. And
6:16
the only other button left in the contact details is the edit button. So, if I want to edit any of these fields
6:23
and update and add a email or something to him, there's a little pencil button on the top right that allows me to edit
6:30
his contact information and I can do that if I would like to. Um, it'll
6:36
update anything about him. So, that's that's, you know, coming over from what
6:41
we've already looked at regarding contacts. Um, those contacts I add will
6:46
show up there. And then you know that's the brief overview of the the contact card that I have for each and every
6:52
contact. And now um me jump over to the dashboard side of things the admin
6:58
panel. If I go over to the contacts view
7:05
there's similar to the outreach view. The first thing you have to notice is there's two um ways to view these
7:12
contacts. I can view them in a list form and this will show me a list of all the
7:18
contacts and then I can click on a contact and I can see the the the
7:26
details of that contact and I can see, you know, similar to what
7:32
we just looked at over on the phone, I can see all of his details and um just in the admin
7:39
way to view them. I can see his emails, phone number, j gender, date of birth. I
7:45
can see all the notes, the followup, and then I can also see any appointments. So, similar to maps, if I share this
7:52
contact with somebody um that's in the church for them to follow up with this person, those appointments will show up
7:59
in this tab. And then, similar to maps, I can edit this person from here. And I can also
8:08
print this person contact information. So, if I want to just uh make a print out and hand a print out to somebody for them to
8:14
go follow up with this person, I can also print that. And similar to maps, you'll want to make sure that you allow
8:20
the popups so that it'll it can open it in the new tab and uh print that PDF.
8:27
Every contact that is added um by every church member will be
8:33
visible from the admin dashboard side of things. So every door knocker that's out
8:39
there adding contacts, they'll all show up in this all contact list and
8:46
um you as an admin will be able to see them all whereas mobile app users can
8:51
only see what um is going to be relevant to them like I had mentioned previously
8:57
the stuff they've already interacted with and so that's why I can see that test John from here that we added and um
9:06
and then they can be moved and sorted uh where they need to be accordingly. They
9:12
can be renamed and organized. And so that's what the purpose of the the folders is. So contacts also have
9:20
folders similar to maps having folders. Um you know, just coming from the paper
9:25
side of things, you know, you want to take individual items and you want to organize them into a um a cluster of
9:33
folders. And so these folders can be used for any different thing any you know for a variety of different
9:40
functions. And so there's no limit on how you need you know on how you can
9:45
organize your folders. You can organize your folders and put contacts in
9:51
um you know in sort them by way of you know your
9:58
your Sunday school classes or um the category of that contact. You know,
10:04
somebody might be interested in baptism. So you might have a baptism folder. Um you might have a VBS folder. You might
10:10
have a VBS, you know, based off of the year. You know, it was 2025 VBS. You
10:16
might have first-time visitors, children's ministry. Um, you know, there is no cap on how you can organize these.
10:25
And so, however you want to organize your contacts, you can organize them this way. And how these folders works
10:32
and I'll explain this to you is your all contacts list is the master
10:40
list. This is this is where the contacts reside. The folders are where they can
10:50
reside. And so um you can put one contact in multiple folders. It's not
10:58
duplicating the contact necessarily, but it's putting that contact um or or you know, and maybe even if you
11:05
want to view them in the way of tagging, it's tagging that contact to what is relevant to that contact. And so,
11:14
you know, if I were wanting to put test John into the baptism folder, I also might want to put test John in the
11:21
follow-up Monday folder. you know, if that's maybe a a a process of how I want
11:27
to continue to follow up with this person. You know, I can put somebody in a members folder, but I can also put
11:32
them in a Sunday school class folder and then a children's ministry folder or something like that. So, folders can be
11:39
added or sorry, contacts can be added to multiple folders. And if I go to this individual folder, I can delete a
11:47
contact. this does not delete the contact out of the master list. It only
11:55
removes it from this folder. And so that's kind of how the how that's
12:00
structured. That's not necessarily a very prominent um understanding when
12:06
you're using the system unless you kind of really test it in the beginning phases and figure that out. So keep that
12:13
in mind as you um move forward and and and structure how you're going to organize your contacts this way. So
12:23
let me show you um a way that you can approach organizing for now. Some of
12:29
this may change uh in the near future when we introduce some um some more
12:35
smart searching capabilities for your contacts. But um as of now, you know,
12:41
you can search you can search your contacts based on their name, but you can this search bar that's on the center
12:49
column of the contacts list also searches the notes field. And so
12:55
remember how we added test John and we put a baptism note in his
13:03
uh in his notes. So let me search baptism
13:11
and hit search. And you'll notice two contacts show up. The one we added
13:19
just uh in the last video and he shows up because baptism is in his notes. And
13:25
then we also have this one here which um previously I had put in uh this testing
13:32
um contact interested in baptism. And so
13:38
That's one way that you can organize them. And so with these search results,
13:43
when these search results pop up with these two contacts, I can select them
13:48
and as I select them, similar to way we did over in the maps, there's a little check box next to each item or I can uh
13:56
pick, you know, pick the select all up top. And uh those those icons will show
14:03
up similar to the way they did on the maps. We'll have the print one. We'll have the folder one, the delete one, and
14:10
the share one. Um the contacts, we have one other one, and I'll share that with you in a moment here. But if I click on
14:16
the folder one, this will allow me to move these two baptism or interested in baptism people or contacts over to the
14:25
baptism folder. And so that's that's kind of a a way to approach organizing
14:31
at at you know at the moment. But you'll want to make sure that you're on top of keeping your your contacts organized and
14:37
not just letting the all list become cluttered and uh you know who knows what's in there and what what needs to
14:43
be followed up with. And so that's kind of the uh the the approach with a simple
14:48
approach and a practical approach with how to organize your contacts. Um,
14:55
and while we're here, let me educate you on um this other icon that shows up when
15:00
we select multiple contacts. So, this other icon that shows
15:06
up is a little street looking icon. And if I click on that street icon, it will
15:12
take me over uh to another feature in the app, the routing feature in the app.
15:18
And this will give me an optimized route to go follow up with these two um
15:24
contacts. And then that route is easily accessible in the mobile app. Um so I
15:31
can pull that route up, look at it, have a really simple, streamlined interface
15:36
for following up with those two contacts and the best way to get from one to the other. And so um that's kind of just a
15:43
brief overview of what that icon does. We will go into routing in depth in
15:48
another video, but I wanted to kind to hit on that while we were here. And so
15:55
the other features um for these icons happen in almost the same fashion that
16:02
the maps do. You have the print that will print these two contacts and then you have the delete, which hopefully is
16:09
very self-explanatory. Um, and then you have the share button.
16:14
And the share will allow me to share this contact with another app user or
16:20
with an app user or church member so that they can go follow up with this person in the process of following up.
16:26
They'll get a notification. They can click on that notification. It'll take them right to the the view in the app
16:32
for um following up with that person. And then
16:40
they'll be able to see those people that have been shared with them in that view in the app, the appointment section in
16:45
the app. And there will be a little navigate button right next to that person. They can click navigate or they
16:51
can click on that contact card and view the details of that contact. And in
16:56
there they'll be able to add um
17:02
add a visit um and and add notes and details to uh
17:08
record a visit for that followup and those notes will will um will be added
17:13
to that contact. And so um same same concept with those with those links. Let
17:20
me share with you um over on the folder section which is the lefth hand column
17:28
um it's going to look very similar to the
17:34
outreach maps. We've we've tried to make the the interface be pretty uniform
17:40
across the different modules and the different capabilities of the software. So much of it looks very similar. And we
17:48
have that add a folder button, which is hopefully pretty self-explanatory. I can click on it and it'll just prompt me to
17:55
name a folder. And I can click save to save that folder. Um, for putting
18:00
contacts in, I can rearrange these folders if I prefer a certain one up top and another one way at the bottom. This
18:07
will allow you to be able to rearrange those. and you have the all list, but you have the map map view or the list
18:14
view toggle button. And so we'll go over into the map view, and I'll show you that here in a second. But over here in
18:22
the list view of these folders, we have the same or similar options that we had
18:30
for the maps. Uh over on this, you know, list of the the folders, we have that
18:35
edit button, which will allow me to click edit. I can rename the folder, but
18:41
I can also turn the visibility of this folder off in the app. And so admin
18:49
users have access to be able to see all of these folders in the app. So, if
18:55
you're like a pastor or something and you're out on the go or a staff member, you can u pull up all of the church
19:02
contacts um database and you can search a certain contact and then just share it
19:08
with a member so they can go follow up with it and you don't have to try to pull up your computer and pull up this
19:14
contact and then be able to u send that contact. or, you know, if you don't want to just share them, but you uh thought
19:21
of somebody you want to go visit and they're not in your personal list, you'll be able to pull that up and then
19:26
go find their information and go follow up with them and make that visit. So, um, admin users have the ability to see
19:33
all of these folders and the contacts in these folders. And so if you want to
19:39
turn a particular one off, like there's a deleted one or you have one that's just deadends or something that's maybe
19:46
a little more confidential, you just don't have any interest in giving even admin users access in the app, you can
19:53
turn the visibility of that um off. And so and I'll go over those um uh that
20:02
navigation over in the mobile app um when we kind of shift back over to the mobile app. contacts in the mobile app
20:08
side of things. So that's the functionality
20:14
um for that there. And if if I switch over to the map view of these contacts,
20:21
the map view gives me um hopefully it's somewhat self-explanatory. We we have um
20:30
still a list of our contacts and a list of the folders, but um over on the right
20:37
hand column, instead of showing each contact card detail,
20:44
we're just shown where they are on a map. And if I select multiple contacts
20:50
or, you know, or I'm viewing the all contact list, I have an overview of where all these contacts are. on a map
20:59
instead of seeing, you know, the details of uh what his phone number is, what his email is, and then a little print button
21:05
to be able to print that contact, you know, or uh or any of the other
21:12
details, the notes. So, none of that stuff is visible, just their name um and
21:18
that that address on the the list in the center column. And then of course I
21:24
still can select multiple ones and um
21:33
move them around. I can delete them, share them and move them to
21:38
another folder from here. So there is um you know some some editing capabilities
21:44
here um regarding that. So if I click on a
21:50
particular folder in this view, it's just going to take me, you know, to view these contacts.
21:56
And over on that lefthand col, the right hand column, sorry, where the map is, it's just going to show those contacts
22:03
on that map. And so that's just kind of a way to get a overview of it. The search works in a similar way. There's a
22:10
search bar on this view. And um and then of course there's always the export
22:16
option and the add a contact option. So, you do have the option either way on the
22:21
map view or the list view to be able to export these uh contacts
22:26
and that are in view and be able to add a new contact
22:36
to um to your list straight from the dashboard
22:43
here.
22:49
There's one other feature over on the list view that I forgot to mention and that is the
22:57
little icons on the folder list. So, when I'm looking at my map, my outreach,
23:03
sorry, my contact folders and the list of those, right next to the
23:09
edit button where I can edit the name and edit the visibility in the app, there's a little QR code looking square,
23:17
you know, four little squares representing like a QR code, uh, little button, and if I click on that, it'll
23:25
give me a QR code uh, and and the, you know, a download button to be able to
23:31
download this QR code. And really, you can also just extract the link from this
23:37
QR code and use this link anywhere. And what this does is allow you to be able
23:42
to uh put either um a button on your website or in the for the purpose of the
23:51
uh QR codes to print this QR code and put it on,
23:56
you know, visitor cards so that people can scan the QR code and fill these visitor cards out to be able to um
24:08
connect with your church. a little easier. And in the process of um scanning this QR code, they'll be
24:15
presented with a form and they can fill out their information and put their
24:20
their own information in. And so that's um basically what they're doing is
24:26
they're putting theirelves in as a contact in your system. But since we're
24:33
generating, you know, um a QR code for this particular folder,
24:39
let's just say the members folder or uh or the first-time visitors folder.
24:46
As this person puts their information in, they're putting themselves in to and
24:53
in in your system and also in the folder that you generated this QR code for for.
25:00
So you can use this for very for many different things. Um tracking where
25:05
people um come in, you know, so if you have a button on your website or you know um how can we pray for you or um
25:14
you know just a place where you want to be able to let people fill out their information on your website. You can you
25:20
can just put a folder that says you know website entries and people that come
25:26
there um can can put their information in. you'll know those contacts came from the website entry or
25:34
you know if you're doing a particular campaign like Easter um and you want to just track what if
25:41
people are actually using the the QR code to put in their contact information to get more information or you're doing
25:48
like a a survey or you're reaching out to people about maybe receiving a free
25:53
Bible or something. You can make these folders just for the purpose of the QR
25:58
code so that you can keep track of um you know how these people are coming into your system and then u move them
26:05
into your follow-up process from there. But you can also just leave these QR codes and use them for multi you know if
26:11
you you have got a members list or something and you want to also be able to you know lots of
26:19
different ways to use this feature. Um,
26:25
but I wanted to make sure I covered that before we move over now to the uh mobile
26:30
app. So, I want to try to cover the mobile app capabilities of the contacts
26:36
more than I already have. So, at this point, we've covered, you know, a little bit of the functionality, but I want to
26:42
go um go over it a little bit more in depth. And so the contacts, like you
26:49
know, you'll want to make sure you navigate over to the contacts view, but once you're there, you'll notice your
26:55
list of contacts. And of course, if you haven't added any, it's going to be empty. And on each contact
27:03
in this list, I'll have a delete button. I can delete my I can delete this
27:09
contact if I'd like to. I have a share button
27:14
and this will allow me as a user if I if I'm like you know hey this really needs to go to this certain bus captain or
27:21
this needs to go to the lady's ministry I let this met this lady and she was really down and out and she needs to be
27:26
followed up by the lady's ministry or something like that and uh or the pastor you know somebody really particularly
27:32
wanted a visit from the pastor um you know these I can share this with you
27:38
know myself you know if I know who this needs to go to. I have the capability of sharing this um and so do admin users.
27:46
Admin users can share these with other people and pastor, you know, you as a pastor can share this with um somebody
27:54
else that needs to go follow up with that. And and it'll do the same thing. If I click the share button, it'll pull
28:00
up a list of all of the people in the church that have uh downloaded the app and connected with it. And I'll just
28:06
find that individual and click the share next to their name. And so then they'll get a notification
28:12
uh to follow up with that user and that will take them over to this um
28:17
appointments tab inside the contacts. And so if if for some reason you want to
28:23
try to navigate to this part of the app, um you can navigate there manually. And
28:29
that's going to be once you're in the contacts section, there's a little plus
28:34
on the bottom right hand corner. And if I click that plus, it's going to
28:41
bring out an expanded view of uh some other options. And so there's a routes
28:47
button. There is a map view. So if I want to not view these contacts that I'm
28:52
looking at in a list, I can pull up the map view of them and see where they are
28:57
on a map in in conjunction also with where I am on
29:03
that map. So it'll show my blue dot. And so if you just need to see, hey, where are they at compared to where I'm at and
29:09
you just want to drive while you're looking at a map from one to somebody else or if there's somebody close to
29:14
you, see if there's, you know, real quick, see if there's somebody close to you while you're out in that part of town so that you can go visit them. Um,
29:22
you know, you can pull up that map view and be able to see that map view for um for that capability.
29:28
And then you also have the appointments in here. And so if I want to manually
29:34
navigate to the appointment section uh so that I can follow up with uh with
29:40
somebody there will be the appointments will be in here. And so I can click on this appointment section see the people
29:47
that have been shared with me click the navigate button or just click on the contact itself and see the uh expanded
29:55
details in their contact uh card. And I can also click the little compass
30:02
looking button on the bottom right. If I don't want to see these people in a list view, I can click on the map view
30:08
button. And this will show them pins where they are on the map in conjunction where I'm at. And of course, you know,
30:15
everywhere we got a map, there's a satellite option. So I can switch to the satellite view if I want to do that. And
30:22
so that's kind of how you can get to the appointment section uh of the contacts. And then the other
30:29
button that's going to be there if you're an admin user. And so if if if if
30:36
I have been given admin access on the dashboard and so where you're going to find that is on the dashboard dropdown
30:43
there will be a little team section. And so in that team you would find that app
30:48
user and so if you give that app user you switch the little you know on the
30:54
far right hand column of that list of users there's uh an admin or a member
30:59
dropdown. So I'll click on that little member drop down next to the user that I'm using right now. Switch them over to
31:07
an admin user. Click change. And now um right now I current can't currently see
31:13
that extra button that I was talking about. But if I kind of just switch over from
31:20
one to the other and then come back that admin but the admin prospects
31:26
button will show up there. It just has a little lock looking button. And if I click on that admin prospects, it's
31:32
going to show me the um list of
31:40
contacts or sorry, it's going to show me the list of folders um that are made a visible um to to the
31:49
contacts. And like I'd mentioned before, you can turn some of those off if you don't want to make them visible. And
31:54
keep in mind when you switch somebody from a member to an admin user, you're
32:00
also going to be you're that that user is going to be logged out. It's going to force them to have to log back in again.
32:08
Um as as it just it just a security measure that's that's
32:14
necessary for the for the system. And so um just keep that in mind. So I just did
32:20
that myself in this video. So you log back in.
32:49
All right, we get back over to contacts, bring up the menu, go to admin,
32:55
prospects, and here you can see the folders, the list of folders, I can
33:03
pull up, if I don't want to look in a particular folder, and I just want to
33:08
look at the all prospects list for everything that the church has access
33:13
to, I can look in that all prospects list, too. And of course there's a little compass. Anytime there's a list
33:20
view of contacts, there's a little that little compass button on the right hand bottom right hand side and that gives
33:26
you the map view of those contacts. So that's kind of how you can do that
33:32
there. And then um there's also the ability to be able to add a contact from
33:38
my list. And so if you need somebody out random, you can add those contacts into
33:43
my list. And um you know, you don't got to be checked into a map.
33:48
Go.
34:02
Another thing to keep in mind just for the sake of this video is all of this data in this account is um it's dummy
34:11
data and it's test data. There's nothing in this account that is uh that is authentic information. And so there's
34:19
nothing, you know, being exposed here or being revealed that's sensitive
34:25
sensitive or private information. It's all just dummy information. So, um
34:31
that's just something I want to notate for the sake of this app and the series of these videos. Nothing here is
34:39
um that I'll be doing in any of these will be
34:45
actual data. From here I want to continue in the same
34:53
video and move over to the routing section of the software that we have.
35:00
And so this the swap app
35:06
because it it very much so um is inseparable from contacts. And so
35:14
contacts and routing are very much so handinand. Um but we do have it you know
35:20
over kind of on its own because it is a very um
35:26
it's got its own cap needs for you know user interface with the uh dashboard
35:32
side of things. So, let's hop over to that. And the way I'm going to hop over
35:38
there is by just clicking on the routing section on
35:43
the dashboard uh on the top, you know, navigation
35:49
options for the the software. So, if I click on routing, it's going to bring up a
36:01
um default view that gives me an option to create a new route or I can look at the
36:09
list of existing routes. And so, uh, if I click on this map or list toggle, the
36:17
list toggle will take me to a very similar looking user interface. We got a
36:23
right-hand column, sorry, a lefth hand column with folders. And then we have a
36:30
center column with individual items. And these would be these individual items are the individual routes that have been
36:37
created and given particular names. And then the right hand column
36:45
is the details of that route. And so
36:55
you'll want to organize these routes into whatever organization fashion that
37:00
you want to organize them into. If you're using this for bus routes, um you know, you'll want to make some folders
37:07
and um name them after your your bus routes or if it's just one bus route,
37:13
you know, you got this folder is for the bus route, you know, this folder is for Tommy's visits, this folder is for um
37:21
Johnny's visits, this folder is for um baptism visits or Monday visits, however
37:28
you want to um do that, you can use the routing for this um for
37:35
these types of things. So, uh make the folders organizing them and then make
37:41
the routes. And so the individual routes will be that center column. And so if I click on an individual route, I'll see
37:48
the details on that right hand column. I can see uh you know two separate tabs.
37:54
Um I can see all of the details of each stop and
38:01
you know how many stops are on this uh and what those addresses are. So, uh,
38:08
this route has, um, this particular route I'm looking at has seven different
38:14
stops. And so, I can see those stops. I can see address number one, and then
38:19
address number two for stop two, number three, number four. And I can also look
38:25
at the sessions. So, there's a little sessions tab that tells me
38:34
um what happened during this visit. And so, if this visit if this route is used on a
38:41
reoccurring basis uh like for a bus route or something like that, you'll be able to see uh how many stops were made
38:49
and when the session happened, when checking out for the final thing happened, and you'll be able to
38:57
um all of the um pins and the locations of each place.
39:05
And so all of the details about this um this route and what happened during this
39:11
route uh and during these visits.
39:23
All right. So that's kind of the overview of how things are how the
39:28
routing is organized. But for the sake of creating routes, the easiest way to
39:34
create a route, I had already mentioned previously back when we were looking in
39:39
the contacts list. And so if you go back to the contacts list, you can select a
39:45
couple contacts that you need to be in a particular route. you know, you might put um you know, 10 or 20 contacts in a
39:54
in a folder and that might be your bus route folder. And
40:03
from there, you'll be able to select all those contacts and click that
40:09
little street button and add them to a route. and it'll pull up the window um
40:16
that we were that were by default dropped into when we click on the routing section. Um but in this window,
40:25
all of the details of creating this route are already filled out. And so
40:31
it's going to the only thing you'll need to fill out will be the route name.
40:39
And so you'll want to name this maybe bus route
40:44
got bus one or Johnny's Johnny's route and or Monday route or however you
40:50
organize your route your your buses or whatever the whatever this purpose of
40:55
this route will be for you know baptism follow-ups or uh Easter
41:01
you know after Easter follow-ups
41:06
you can put that name in in here so that you know what the purpose of this route is for. And then you'll just want to set
41:13
the start and the stop location. And so the easiest way to really fill these start and stop locations in is probably
41:20
just to put your church address. And you don't need to type the church address. This is a goo this this is going to be
41:27
if your church shows up on Google Maps, just search your church name. And so you
41:33
know, for instance, here we're going to look at Lake LA
41:41
Baptist Church. So, I don't have to type in, you know, the address for church. I
41:46
could just type in the place and the place will also show up. And so, I would
41:51
uh fill that um start location and then the stop location
41:56
out, which would be the same thing.
42:23
And then the stops are automatically filled in if you've selected the
42:28
contacts and then hit that street icon. All of the stops. But if you want to
42:34
fill in a manual route, you can do that. And so if you
42:40
know the contacts names, you can um start adding them in the list of stops.
42:48
And so I can start typing, you know, test.
42:54
And I can add that that contact that we added earlier, test John.
43:02
And if I want to add another stop, I'll add another stop location. type their
43:07
name testing.
43:14
I'll put add that testing stop that showed up with the other baptism one and any other name. Just start typing their
43:20
name. Um and and so you can add as many of these
43:25
as you want. You can just keep going with that and then you know give it that f name
43:31
that you want to give it. I'll just name it testing for now, but or testing bus. How about that? And then
43:39
you'll just click the little optimize button. If you've done something wrong and you need to clear it all back off, there's a little clear up clear button.
43:46
And then as you're filling the details of this route out, you do have a map
43:51
view on the right hand side. And you'll notice pins start popping up on that map
43:57
view as you're adding the stops, the the start location, then the finish location
44:03
and then all the stops. Um along the way, those pins will start
44:08
showing up and then I'm going to hit optimize and it's just going to take an optimized route for uh which stops to go
44:15
to first and how to make that path. And that's going to be the recommended path
44:20
for um the best way to accomplish that um set of contacts. And so the
44:28
alternative sometimes when you're looking in a list is to just look at it in order and try to make sense of it.
44:34
But this will tell you which ones it you should go to first. Um that might not
44:39
be, you know, on the top of that list. So it's just going to be the best way to do that. And that all does hinge upon
44:46
the start and the stop location. So you know that that is a necessary
44:52
um part of the part of the equation. And so we'll hit create this route. And
45:03
that's that's kind of how that all of that works. And so, um, that's contacts
45:09
and routing. So, from here,
45:15
we're going to move over into um
45:20
ministries. And I want to show you uh ministries
45:26
and the functionality that is there. But um there will be two other things that I
45:32
will need to show you before we go into ministries. And that's going to be the uh you know the the news feed or the
45:40
prayer feed and then the events uh section of the app. And so both of those
45:45
are combined inside ministries um or groups. And so we'll we'll go over that
45:51
in the next video in great detail.
